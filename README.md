# MicrobitAirMouse
run the microbit as airmouse on Ubuntu

This is just a prototype attemt to get the microbit connected over usb
and using it as an airmouse. 

there are 2 pieces of code to get it working : 

1. the python code
2. the hex file that you need to flash to the microbit
   i suggest you use the online microbit editor to do this
   its a makecode hex file, on the to do list is a micropython version.
